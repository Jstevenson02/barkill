# Web Game App

## Description
This project is a simple web-based game where players control a bar at the bottom of the screen using the A and D keys to move left and right. A ball bounces around the screen, ricocheting off the walls and the bar. Players score points by hitting blocks at the top of the screen, which have varying score values.

## Features
- Control the bar using the A and D keys.
- A bouncing ball that interacts with the bar and blocks.
- Scoring system that increments points when the ball hits blocks.
